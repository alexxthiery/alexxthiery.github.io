    "text": "Denoising Score Matching & Tweedie formula\n\n\n\n\nMaurice Tweedie (1919–1996)\n\n\n\nThe previous section shows that a quantity often referred to as the “score” in machine learning (ML) literature, i.e. \\(\\mathcal{S}_t(x) \\equiv \\nabla_x \\log p_t(x)\\), naturally arises when a diffusion process runs backward in time. Interestingly, it is worth noting that since the beginning of times statisticians have been using the term “score” to refer to the other derivative, i.e. the derivative with respect to a model’s parameter, which is a completely different object!\nConsider a Brownian diffusion process \\(dX = \\sigma \\, dW\\) initiated from a distribution \\(\\mu(dx) = p_0(dx)\\). If this process is ran forward for a duration \\(\\delta&gt;0\\), we have:\n\\[X_{\\delta} = X_0 + N(0, \\sigma^2 \\, \\delta)\\]\nwhere \\(X_0 \\sim \\mu(dx)\\). Now, focusing on a specific sample \\(y = X_{\\delta}\\), the backward dynamics \\(d\\overleftarrow{X} = \\sigma^2 \\, \\nabla \\log p_t(\\overleftarrow{X}) , dt + \\sigma \\, dB\\) suggests that for sufficiently small \\(\\delta\\), the following approximation holds:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X_0 \\, | X_{\\delta} = y] \\; { \\color{\\red} \\approx} \\; y + \\nabla \\log p_{\\delta}(y) \\, \\sigma^2 \\delta.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nMaybe surprisingly, in the case of Brownian dynamics (no drift), this relationship holds exactly, even for arbitrarily large time increments \\(\\delta&gt;0\\). This observation attributed in (Efron 2011) to Maurice Tweedie (1919–1996) has a straightforward proof. Specifically, if \\(X \\sim \\mu(dx)\\), then \\(Y = X + N(0, \\Gamma^2)\\) has a density given by:\n\\[\np_Y(dy) = \\int \\mu(x) \\, \\rho_{\\Gamma}(y-x) \\, dx\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho_{\\Gamma}(z) \\propto \\exp[-z^2/(2 \\Gamma^2)]\\) is a centred Gaussian with variance \\(\\Gamma^2\\). It follows that\n\\[\n\\frac{ \\mathbb{E}[X \\, | Y = y]-y}{\\Gamma^2} = \\frac{ \\int \\left( \\frac {x-y }{\\Gamma^2} \\right)\\, \\mu(x) \\, \\rho_{\\Gamma}(y-x) \\, dx }{\\int \\mu(x) \\, \\rho_{\\Gamma}(y-x) \\, dx}\n=\n\\nabla_y \\log \\left\\{ \\int \\mu(x) \\, \\rho_{\\Gamma}(y-x) \\, dx \\right\\}\n\\]\nsince \\(\\nabla_y \\rho_{\\Gamma}(y-x) = (x-y)/\\Gamma^2\\). This leads to Tweedie’s formula:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[X \\, | Y = y] \\; {\\color{red} =} \\; y + \\Gamma^2 \\, \\nabla \\log p_Y(y),\n\\]\nwhich is exactly the same as Equation 3 but with an equality sign: no approximation needed! Interestingly, this is what Machine-Learners often refer to as “denoising score matching” (Vincent 2011): if we have access to a large number of samples \\((X_i,Y_i)\\), where \\(X_i \\sim \\mu(dx)\\) and \\(Y_i = X_i + N(0, \\Gamma^2)\\), and fit a regression model \\(F_{\\theta}\\) by minimizing the mean-squared error \\(\\theta \\mapsto \\mathbb{E} \\|X - F_{\\theta}(Y)\\|^2\\), then Tweedie formula shows that in the limit of infinite samples and with sufficient flexibility in the regression model \\(F_{\\theta_\\star}(y) = y + \\Gamma^2 \\nabla \\log p_Y(y)\\). This allows one to estimate \\(\\nabla \\log p_Y\\) from data, which is often a good approximation of \\(\\nabla \\log \\mu\\) if the variance \\(\\Gamma^2\\) of the added noise is not too large. Indeed, things can go bad if \\(\\Gamma^2\\) is very small and the number of training data is not large, no free lunch!"
